            <h1>Why ICT?</h1>
            <p>I’ve been interested in technology for as long as I can remember. I started by taking apart old PCs just
                to see how they worked, and over time I learned how to build and fix them myself. My dad works in the
                ICT department at ADRZ hospital, so I’ve seen firsthand how important and impactful ICT can be in
                real-world situations. That really motivated me to explore the field more seriously.</p>

            <p>Besides hardware, I also have a little bit of experience with web development. I like having the freedom to
                think creatively, which is why I've been learning html & css. But I've also been using Photoshop and other
                Adobe tools. Being able to combine technical skills with creativity is something I find really exciting.
            </p>

            <p>The HBO-ICT programme gives me the chance to grow in both areas: technical and creative. I want to turn my
                passion into something meaningful. ICT feels like the perfect field for me to do that.</p>
