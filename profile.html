        <h1> About Me </h1>
        <p>My name is Mees Groeneveld, I'm first year ICT-student at HZ university of applied sciences. I'm 20 years old, born and raised in Vlissingen!</p>
        <p>In my free time I really enjoy practicing all kind of sports. At the moment my goal is to finish a triathlon in 2026, so most of my active time is spent on training for that. But all these sports don't stop me from enjoying life, I love spending weekends with friends. Whether it’s at a festival, a terrace, or just enjoying a drink together.</p>
        <p>Whenever I do manage to find some time where I have nothing planned I love to watch a movie or series. I'm a big film enthusiast so feel free to ask me for some recommendations!</p>

        <h1> Experience </h1>
        <p>I’ve been exploring tech from a young age. Building my own desktop PCs since I was 13 gave me a solid foundation in both hardware and software. </p>
        <p>I have experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I enjoy the creative side of front-end development. I like bringing ideas to life visually and making interfaces feel intuitive. I'm also skilled in Photoshop and Illustrator, which helps me blend design with code.
