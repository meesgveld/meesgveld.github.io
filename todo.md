What do you see yourself doing after completing the program? For example what profession or role interests you? why? and what do you hope to have learned in four years?
After completing the IT program, I see myself pursuing a career as a software engineer. I’ve always been drawn to the idea of building things with code and solving real-world problems through technology. That said, I’m still exploring exactly where I’d like to apply those skills. I’m particularly interested in areas like cybercrime or working with an organization such as the Ministry of Defence. The idea of contributing to national security or helping to prevent cyber threats is something that really appeals to me, but I’d like to learn more before deciding.

Do you have a hobby for example or an interest that you would like to share something about?

I’m really into sports and staying active is a big part of my life. Right now, I’m actually starting to train for a triathlon, which is a new challenge I'm really excited for. I recently bought a new bike, so I’ve been spending a lot of time cycling and running. I still have to start swimming to make sure my form improves. I think it will be tough, but I enjoy pushing myself and seeing progress. I find that having a goal like this helps keep me motivated and focused.
